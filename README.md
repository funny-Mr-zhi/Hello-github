# Hello-github
This repository is for practising the GitHub Flow.

In readme-edits branch. I changed the README files.
My name is Zhiyan Liu, and I'm practicing how to use github on the browser.


## The process to make some change

**Note: do not change the main branch directly.**
* create a new branch
* chanege in new branch
* create pull to main branch
* merge changes to main and delete temporary branch.
